Apollo Client is the ultra-flexible, community driven GraphQL client for Angular, JavaScript, and native platforms. It is designed from the ground up to make it easy to build UI components that fetch data with GraphQL. To get the most value out of Apollo Client, you should use it with one of its view layer integrations. To get started with the Angular integration, go to setup.
Apollo Client also has view layer integrations for all the popular frontend frameworks. For the best experience, make sure to use the view integration layer for your frontend framework of choice.

Apollo Client can be used in any JavaScript frontend where you want to describe your data using GraphQL. It’s:

Incrementally adoptable, so that you can drop it into an existing JavaScript app and start using GraphQL for just part of your UI.
Universally compatible, so that Apollo works with any build setup, any GraphQL server, and any GraphQL schema.
Simple to get started with, so you can start loading data right away and learn about advanced features later.
Inspectable and understandable, so that you can have great developer tools to understand exactly what is happening in your app.
Built for interactive apps, so your users can make changes and see them reflected in the UI immediately.
Small and flexible, so you don’t get stuff you don’t need. The core is under 12kb compressed.
Community driven, because Apollo is driven by the community and serves a variety of use cases. Everything is planned and developed in the open.
These docs will help you to go from getting started with Apollo to becoming an expert!
